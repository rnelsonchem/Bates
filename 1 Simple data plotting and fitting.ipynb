Typically, these need to be installed separately, but there are several options to make this much easier for the user. (For example, SageMathCloud comes with these libraries preinstalled.) Python's `import` statement is used to load any extra code, and in this case, we will be using the following libraries:\n",

Lines preceded by `%` or `%%` are special to IPython and will only work inside this environment. In this case, `%matplotlib inline` simply forces Matplotlib plots to be displayed in the notebook webpage rather than the default which is a separate interactive window.
