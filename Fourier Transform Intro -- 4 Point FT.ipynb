      "\n",
      "For a continuous signal, the [Fourier transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) (FT, Equation 1) is simply the integral of a time-domain (complex) function, $f(t)$, multiplied by an imaginary exponential function.\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\mathrm{Equation\\ 1:}\\ \\ \\ F( \\nu ) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} f(t) e^{- i 2 \\pi \\nu t} \\mathrm{d}t$$\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two things to keep in mind here. First of all, the frequency term in the exponential is equivalent to radians (Equation 2). Also, an exponential of an imaginary number can be expanded by [Euler's Formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula) (Equation 3).\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\mathrm{Equation\\ 2:}\\ \\ \\ \\omega=2 \\pi \\nu$$\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\mathrm{Equation\\ 3:}\\ \\ \\ e^{- i 2 \\pi \\nu t}=\\cos(2 \\pi \\nu t) + i \\sin(2 \\pi \\nu t)$$\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, Equation 1 can be expanded in terms of sines and cosines (Equation 4).\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\mathrm{Equation\\ 4:}\\ \\ \\ F( \\nu ) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} f(t) \\cos(2 \\pi \\nu t) \\mathrm{d}t + i \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} f(t) \\sin(2 \\pi \\nu t) \\mathrm{d}t$$\n",
      "\n",
      "For functions that are easily integrable and infinite, this equation can be solved exactly. However, in most real situations (such as a spectroscopic signal) this time domain function is a very complex, finite signal that can not be easily integrated. In this case, we need to use a [Discrete Fourier Transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform) (Equation 5).\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\mathrm{Equation\\ 5:}\\ \\ \\ F( \\nu_{m} ) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_{n} e^{- i 2 \\pi n m / N}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "Where the *x* values are the *N* total discrete data points, and *m/N* are the frequencies for the complex sinusoidal functions, with *m* taking the following values: \n",
      "\n",
      "$$m( \\mathrm{even} ) = \\frac{-N}{2}, \\frac{-N}{2}+1, \\cdots , \\frac{-N}{2} + (N-1)$$\n",
      "\n",
      "$$m( \\mathrm{odd} ) = \\frac{-(N-1)}{2}, \\frac{-(N-1)}{2}+1, \\cdots , \\frac{-(N-1)}{2} + N$$\n",
      "\n",
      "Again this can be expanded using Euler's Formula. \n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\mathrm{Equation\\ 6:}\\ \\ \\ F( \\nu_{m} ) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_{n} [\\cos(2 \\pi n m / N) + i \\sin(2 \\pi n m / N)]$$\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, efficient computational alogrithms were developed for this equation many years ago and are collectively known as [Fast Fourier Transformations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) (FFT). It is not an overstatement to say that these algorithms revolutionized spectrocopic methods. \n",
      "\n",
      "Below, we will first look at a very simple, contrived example FT just to make sure that we understand how it works in general. Next, we will explore some of the properties of this transformation by looking at some simulated data that more accurately reflects real world situations.\n",
