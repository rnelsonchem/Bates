      "In this demonstration, we'll make a very simple plot of a couple of mathematical functions, and then we will use this to illustrate how you would be able to make a stack plot of spectra like the [one shown below](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24368-stacked-plot).\n",

      "To start, let's consider what it takes to make a plot of a mathematical function (or some data you've collected). A line plot in a [Cartesian coordinate system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system) is generated by taking at the minimum two points -- $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ -- and connecting them with a line. This is shown on the left in the figure below. If we have another point, $(x_3, y_3)$, we can add that point to our plot and draw a line connecting this new point to the previous one (center). If we continue this process for a large number of points, we would add all of these points to our graph and connect them with a line (right).\n",

      "Using this procedure, it is fairly simple to see how you would plot a data set that you collect in the lab -- e.g. concentration (y data) versus time (x dat) How can we use this procedure to simulate a mathematical function? In a cartesian coordinate system, we have to remember that the value of any mathematical function ($f$) will be related to some input value. If we consider our input to the function to be our x data, then we can define the output of our function as the y data. \n",

      "$$ y_n = f(x_n) $$\n",

      "A common convention in Python is to load any third party code at the beginning of any program using the `import` statement. In this case, we'll load up two external cody libraries: [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) makes it easy to work with numbers in Python, and [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) is a very nice plotting library. We'll use the `as` notation to give these libraries a nickname. That way we don't have to type out their full name every time we want to use them."
