      "In this demonstration, we'll make a very simple plot of a couple of simulated mathematical functions, and then we will use this to illustrate how you would be able to make a stack plot of spectra like the [one shown below](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24368-stacked-plot).\n",

      "To start, let's consider what it takes to make a plot of a mathematical function (or some data you've collected). A plot in a [Cartesian coordinate system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system) is generated by taking at the minimum two points -- $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ -- and connecting them with a line. This is shown on the left in the figure below. If we have another point, $(x_3, y_3)$, we can add that point to our plot and draw a line connecting this new point to the previous one (center). If we continue this process for a large number of points, we would add all of these points to our graph and connect them with a line (right).\n",

      "Using this procedure, it is fairly simple to see how you would plot a data set that you collect in the lab -- e.g. concentration (y data) versus time (x dat) How can we use this procedure to simulate a mathematical function? In a cartesian coordiate system, we have to remember that the value of any mathematical function ($f$) will be related to some input value. If we consider our input to the function to be our x data, then we can define the output of our function as the y data. \n",

      "Okay. Now that we've learned how to simulate a mathematical function, let's see if we can think about how to make a stack plot like we saw in the beginning. Take a look at that picture and think a little about what is happening. If we plotted that data normally, everything would overlap in the same way that our functions overlap in the simulation above. What is different between the first data set line (lowest one) and the second data set line? Well really it looks like the x data starts and ends at a slightly larger value and the lowest point (baseline) of the y data is at slightly larger overall values. This analysis gives us an idea of how we might accomplish this task, and it's really quite simple. Let's just add a small constant value to both the x and y data. That causes an *offset* of the second data set relative to our first one."
