      "This notebook reproduces an analysis that I did for a [manuscript that I wrote](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo4014113?journalCode=joceah) with my colleague [Prof. Benjamin Gorske at Bowdoin College](). The final figure, shown below, can be found in the [Supporting Information](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jo4014113) for the paper, and was crucial for the final interpretation of the data. The code in this notebook represents a great deal of work on my part, and the complexity of the code reflects that effort. I did my best to minimize my original code to the most important features and to explain as much as I can along the way.\n",

      "Subtle changes in chemical structure can sometimes have a drastic consequences in reactivity. My colleague Prof. Gorske is studying peptoids -- which are analogous to peptides, one of Nature's building blocks -- but they possess some unusal and pretty cool properties. Prof. Gorske [had developed some model systems](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja071310l), and found that subtle changes in the chemical composition of these models produced drastic differences in reactivity. An example of one of these model systems is shown below.\n",

      "<img src=\"static/peptoid.svg\" style=\"width:20%;\">\n",
      "\n",
      "In this particular model, removing the \"NO<sub>2</sub>\" group drastically changes the geometric preference at the amide (N-C=O) or thioamide (N-S=O) group on the other end of the ring. \n",
      "\n",
      "*How are these compositional changes at one end of the molecule affecting properties at the other end?* We postulated that there was a electronic connectivity network between the \"NO<sub>2</sub>\" and the (thio)amide. To do this, I worked on calculating some special type of theoretical electon orbitals called [Natural Bond Orbitals (NBO)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_bond_orbital). NBOs are localized on certain fragments of the molecule; however, they can interact with each other in ways that stabilize the overall molecular structure. An example of this interaction is shown in the picture below -- an animated movie can be found in the shared folder.\n",
      "\n",
      "<img src=\"static/020.png\" style=\"width:50%;\">\n",
      "\n",
      "In this picture, the transparent blue and red lobes represent one NBO and the green and yellow lobes represent another NBO. The interaction/overlap of these orbitals leads to an overall stabilization of this molecule. These NBO-NBO interactions form a very large and complicated *connectivity network*. In order to analyze this efficiently, I used network analysis library [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/). \n",
      "\n",
      "There was another problem that needed to be addressed as well -- handling the large amounts of data. Prof. Gorske had synthesized several of these molecules, and for the theoretical analysis, multiple calculations for each model compound needed to be run and compared. I generated somewhere around 650 MB of *compressed* output files that I needed to parse. (These are just like Gaussian output files from by Text Parsing notebook.) The details of that procedure are beyond the scope of this example, but after extracting the information from the output files, I needed a convenient way to store and access the data. \n",
      "\n",
      "To this end, I chose the open-source [Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) file format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format). These files are specifically designed for high-performance storage and access of very large scientific data sets. Python has at least two libraries for these files [PyTables](http://www.pytables.org/moin) and [h5py](http://www.h5py.org/) -- I chose PyTables for my analysis."
